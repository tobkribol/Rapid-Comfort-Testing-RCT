## Problem
• Humans spend 87% of their time indoors, mostly in their own residence

• Visual comfort has a contradictory effect on the thermal comfort and energy use.

• Optimization is essential for finding an optimum solution for these criteria.

• Building performance optimization require huge computational resources.

## Solution
• Find the contribution form daylight and overheating for each grid cell in a zone/building/room.

• Train a data model to recognize patterns for building optimization based on output data (thermal and visual comfort)
